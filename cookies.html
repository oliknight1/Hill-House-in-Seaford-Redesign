            <p>Cookies are small pieces of data stored in text files that are saved on your computer or other devices
                when websites are loaded in a browser. They are widely used to remember you and your preferences, either
                for a single visit (through a &quot;session cookie&quot;) or for multiple repeat visits (using a
                &quot;persistent cookie&quot;).</p>
            <p>Session cookies are temporary cookies that are used during the course of your visit to the Website, and
                they expire when you close the web browser.</p>
            <p>Persistent cookies are used to remember your preferences within our Website and remain on your desktop or
                mobile device even after you close your browser or restart your computer. They ensure a consistent and
                efficient experience for you while visiting our Website or using our Services.</p>

                to delete cookies that have already been set and to not accept new cookies. To learn more about how to
